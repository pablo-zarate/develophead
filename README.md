# develophead
English: 
Hi! Thanks for looking at my project!

This is the Develophead, a project I started on Dec'17 to help me develop more C41 rolls without having to worry on the agitation, specially when bleaching time is about sixteen minutes. It was also called 'agitatron' but since I decided to open it for everyone, the name was changed. (that's why files are called that way) It is only for the AP brand of developing tanks, more to come with your help, I hope!

As I am from México, my english is not that good, but here we go:

The project is a cap that has one servo that moves the central core of the tank by 180 degrees on a cycle (goes back and forth), it only uses the arduino power (5v) which you can get from a external battery or the phone wall charger. You may even modify it to use another kinds of power source. (I plug it on the USB port of the arduino, which I know its wrong but haven't had any issues on 6 months of use)

I've been using the developcap since Dec'17, testing parts and comparing the results from over a hundred c41 rolls, and also modifiying the program mode to get better results. The files I uploaded are the ones that I use and been working on. It may change a little on dimensions due to different printers or heads or even differences on tanks, but nothing that can't be fixed without superglue. (you will need some superglue BTW).

There is a lot more info on the Readme.txt about program mode. Please check it out! Also, I modified a thingiverse file which is linked there. 

Any comments, feel free to DM me at twitter https://twitter.com/REptar or follow me on http://instagram.com/elreptar

Hola! En el readme hay más información, pero les adelanto que lo inicié en diciembre del 2017 y he revelado ya unos 100 rollos de C41. El "aparato" consiste en una tapa para tanques AP que realiza la agitación de los rollos utilizando un servo. Está 
programado en arduino, así que los tiempos son modificables sin problemas. 

En las carpetas está desde el código hasta los STL para imprimirlo y ponerlo a trabajar. Chequen el readme.txt, ahí está la información más extendida del proyecto y sus instrucciones. Cualquier duda, pueden contactarme en twitter o instagram, https://twitter.com/REptar, http://instagram.com/elreptar. Y con gusto resuelvo sus dudas :)
